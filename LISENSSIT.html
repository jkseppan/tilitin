    MySQL Connector/J: GPL v2, with Universal FOSS Exception

</h3><p>
Combined with Tilitin in accordance with the Universal FOSS Exception.
</p><p>
This release of MySQL Connector/J 9.0.0 Community is brought to you by
the MySQL team at Oracle. This software is released under version 2 of
the GNU General Public License (GPLv2), as set forth below, with the
following additional permissions:
</p><p>
This distribution of MySQL Connector/J 9.0.0 Community is designed to
work with certain software that is licensed under separate terms, as
designated in a particular file or component or in the license
documentation. Without limiting your rights under the GPLv2, the
authors of MySQL hereby grant you an additional permission to link the
program and your derivative works with the separately licensed software
that they have either included with the program or referenced in the
documentation.
</p><p>
Without limiting the foregoing grant of rights under the GPLv2 and
additional permission as to separately licensed software, this
Connector is also subject to the Universal FOSS Exception, version 1.0,
a copy of which is reproduced below and can also be found along with
its FAQ at http://oss.oracle.com/licenses/universal-foss-exception.
</p><p>
Copyright (c) 2017, 2024, Oracle and/or its affiliates.
</p><h4>

    The Universal FOSS Exception, Version 1.0

</h4><p>
In addition to the rights set forth in the other license(s) included
in the distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation
(collectively the "Software," and such licenses collectively with
this additional permission the "Software License"), the copyright
holders wish to facilitate interoperability with other software,
data, and/or documentation distributed with complete corresponding
source under a license that is OSI-approved and/or categorized by
the FSF as free (collectively "Other FOSS").  We therefore hereby
grant the following additional permission with respect to the use
and distribution of the Software with Other FOSS, and the constants,
function signatures, data structures and other invocation methods
used to run or interact with each of them (as to each, such software's
"Interfaces"):
</p><p>
(i) The Software's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the
license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in
the Other FOSS in order to enable interoperability, without requiring
a change to the license of the Other FOSS other than as to any
Interfaces of the Software embedded therein.  The Software's
Interfaces remain at all times under the Software License, including
without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon any such
use also then contains a portion of the Software under the Software
License).
</p><p>
(ii) The Other FOSS's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by
the license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed
in the Software in order to enable interoperability, without requiring
that such Interfaces be licensed under the terms of the Software
License or otherwise altering their original terms, if this does
not require any portion of the Software other than such Interfaces
to be licensed under the terms other than the Software License.
</p><p>
(iii) If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the
Software and the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or
distribution of the Software with the Other FOSS shall not be deemed
to require that the Other FOSS be licensed under the license of the
Software, other than as to any Interfaces of the Software copied
into the Other FOSS.  This includes, by way of example and without
limitation, statically or dynamically linking the Software together
with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the Interfaces
of one or both, and distributing the resulting combination under
different licenses for the respective portions thereof.
</p><p>
For avoidance of doubt, a license which is OSI-approved or categorized
by the FSF as free, includes, for the purpose of this permission,
such licenses with additional permissions, and any license that has
previously been so-approved or categorized as free, even if now
deprecated or otherwise no longer recognized as approved or free.
Nothing in this additional permission grants any right to distribute
any portion of the Software on terms other than those of the Software
License or grants any additional permission of any kind for use or
distribution of the Software in conjunction with software other
than Other FOSS.
